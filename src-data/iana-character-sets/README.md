# IANA Character Sets

These are the official names for character sets that may be used in
the Internet and may be referred to in Internet documentation.  These
names are expressed in ANSI_X3.4-1968 which is commonly called
US-ASCII or simply ASCII.  The character set most commonly use in the
Internet and used especially in protocol standards is US-ASCII, this
is strongly encouraged.  The use of the name US-ASCII is also
encouraged.

The data file `character-sets-1.csv` was sourced from 
[IANA](https://www.iana.org/assignments/character-sets/character-sets.xhtml);
the data file `people.tsv` was scraped from the bottom table on
the same page.
