# ISO 3166 - Country Codes

The purpose of ISO 3166 is to define internationally recognised codes 
of letters and/or numbers that we can use when we refer to countries 
and subdivisions. However, it does not define the names of countries
â€“ this information comes from United Nations sources (Terminology 
Bulletin Country Names and the Country and Region Codes for Statistical 
Use maintained by the United Nations Statistics Divisions).

The data file `all.csv` was sourced from 
[Github](https://github.com/lukes/ISO-3166-Countries-with-Regional-Codes).
