# ISO 4217:2015 - Currency codes

Currencies can be represented in the code in two ways: a three-letter alphabetic 
code and a three-digit numeric code.

The most recent edition is ISO 4217:2015. The purpose of ISO 4217:2015 is to 
establish internationally recognised codes for the representation of currencies. 

The data file `list_one.xls` was sourced from 
[ISO.org](https://www.iso.org/iso-4217-currency-codes.html).
