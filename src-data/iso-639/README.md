# ISO 4217:2015 - Currency codes

Currencies can be represented in the code in two ways: a three-letter alphabetic
code and a three-digit numeric code.

The most recent edition is ISO 4217:2015. The purpose of ISO 4217:2015 is to
establish internationally recognised codes for the representation of currencies.
